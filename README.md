EXTRACTED FROM HOMEWORK FILE:
A blend word is a word made by combining other words; e.g. turboast (turbo + boast), witchins (witch + chins), and helloaf (hello + loaf). In this assignment, youâ€™ll construct such blend words consisting of words that overlap by exactly two characters. Blend words can also be made three or more words, e.g. gumbotchamp (gumbo + botch + champ), hoistakebabyss (hoist + stake + kebab + abyss), and eleventiceliactualpacayugazebonsaikido (eleven + entice + celiac + actual + alpaca + cayuga + gazebo + bonsai + aikido).
